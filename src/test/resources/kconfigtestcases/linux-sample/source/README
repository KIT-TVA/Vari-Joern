This is a test case for Linux's variant of the Kconfig/Kbuild system. It
was created from the Linux kernel source code (v6.7) by stripping out
most files that are not needed for this test case. Also, the src directory
containing sample C code was added and the Kconfig files were modified
accordingly.
