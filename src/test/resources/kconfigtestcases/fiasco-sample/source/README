This is a test case for Fiasco's variant of the Kconfig system. It
was created from the Fiasco's source code by stripping out
most files that are not needed for this test case. Also, sample C
code was added to the src directory and the Kconfig files were modified
accordingly. The original source code of Fiasco can be found at
https://github.com/kernkonzept/fiasco.
