This is a test case for Toybox's variant of the Kconfig system. It
was created from the Toybox source code (version 0.8.12,
see https://github.com/landley/toybox/tree/0.8.12) by stripping out
most files that are not needed for this test case. A test C program
was added in the toys/example directory.
